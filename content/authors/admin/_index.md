I am currently a 3rd-year PhD student in Clinical Medicine at the University of Oxford. My interdisciplinary background spans clinical epidemiology, pharmacology, and pharmaceutical engineering. My current research interest is in exploiting electronic health records data to improve infection management.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I am highly skilled in data cleaning and manipulation, particularly with large-scale, multi-dimensional healthcare data. I am proficient in using various data visualisation and reporting tools to reveal key insights from complex datasets. Having garnered extensive experience in regression modelling of longitudinal healthcare data, I am passionate about leveraging data and analytics to address real-world health issues.
